Mobile Development I - Project<br>
Due October 3/22<br>

Created my first initial npx and did npm install of what is needed. I am using npm react-native-neat-date-picker to get the date selection rather than the date input.<br>
When you click the button to open up the calendar, it will pop up, click on the year and select the year you were born in(yes a lot of clicking), once you selected your year hit outside the box to bring you to the month, use the left and right arrow to select your month then follow your day then hit ok. A text will appear and show you the date you've selected.<br>

The math part took me way too long to figure this out. There were many different way I could of achieved this but this was what came best to me and from what I had searched. <br>
I have not figured out how to make the button appear enabled when the date selected so I left it the way I saw it.<br>
***Shout out to Tom and Grant for assisting me when needed. Thank you***
